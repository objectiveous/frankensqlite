# `fsqlite-wasm`

`fsqlite-wasm` is the Rust crate that produces FrankenSQLite's browser-facing
WebAssembly package.

The intended npm artifact is published as `@frankensqlite/core` and exposes the
generated `wasm-bindgen` glue plus the `FrankenDB` / `FrankenPreparedStatement`
APIs implemented in [`src/lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs).

## Package Build

Build the primary browser ES module package into `target/fsqlite-wasm-pkg/`:

```bash
./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh
```

Choose a different output directory or `wasm-pack` target:

```bash
FSQLITE_WASM_TARGET=bundler ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh target/fsqlite-wasm-bundler
FSQLITE_WASM_TARGET=nodejs ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh target/fsqlite-wasm-node
```

The helper script:

- runs `wasm-pack build`
- uses the workspace size-optimized `release` profile (`opt-level = "z"`,
  LTO, one codegen unit, stripped symbols, aborting panics)
- runs `wasm-opt` explicitly after wasm-bindgen output, with Rust's
  bulk-memory and nontrapping-float feature flags enabled, then keeps the
  optimized output only when it is no larger after gzip, without leaving a
  rejected optimizer side artifact in the package directory
- normalizes the generated `package.json` to the `@frankensqlite/core` package name
- copies README/license files into the output package
- validates the generated `.wasm`, `.js`, and `.d.ts` artifacts exist
- can build a minimum-feature core package with
  `FSQLITE_WASM_NO_DEFAULT_FEATURES=1`
- can enable opt-in diagnostics such as
  `FSQLITE_WASM_FEATURES=diagnostics,tracing,panic-hook`
- can make optimizer availability explicit with `FSQLITE_WASM_WASM_OPT`
  (`required`, `auto`, or `disabled`)
- can postprocess an existing wasm-bindgen output directory without invoking
  `wasm-pack` or cargo by setting `FSQLITE_WASM_PACKAGE_ONLY=1`
- can refuse local `wasm-pack` execution with
  `FSQLITE_WASM_FORBID_LOCAL_BUILD=1`, which is useful for agent runs where
  cargo-shaped work must happen through `rch`
- strips caller-location file/line/column detail from release/profiling builds
  by default with `-Zlocation-detail=none`
- emits `twiggy-top.txt` when `twiggy` is available, or requires it with
  `FSQLITE_WASM_TWIGGY=required`
- writes `frankensqlite_wasm_bg.wasm.gz` and enforces the 800 KB core gzip
  budget by default (`FSQLITE_WASM_MAX_GZIP_BYTES=0` disables the guard)
- writes `size-report.json` with the raw wasm bytes, gzipped wasm bytes,
  wasm-opt retention decision, size budgets, and final npm tarball bytes
- runs `npm pack` so the result is ready for registry or local install testing
- enforces a packed tarball size budget of 2 MiB by default (`FSQLITE_WASM_MAX_PACKED_BYTES=0` disables the guard)

The default crate feature set is intentionally empty so the core browser
package does not carry crash-reporting or diagnostics glue. Minimum-core release
wasm builds compile tracing at `error` level only and strip caller-location
detail to keep metadata out of the core download. The default browser package
leaves FrankenSQLite-specific observability PRAGMAs and browser-facing
introspection exports out of the core transfer. Enable the `diagnostics` feature
when a build needs `parseSql()`, `db.path`, `db.explain()`,
prepared-statement `explain()`, prepared-statement metadata getters (`stmt.sql`,
`stmt.columnCount`, `stmt.columnNames()`), `db.memoryStats()`,
`PRAGMA fsqlite.jit_stats`,
`PRAGMA fsqlite.cache_stats`, `PRAGMA fsqlite.txn_stats`, lineage, SSI,
JavaScript NaN coercion warnings, or diagnostic error recovery fields such as
`transient`, `userRecoverable`, and `suggestion`, query-result `changes`
placeholders, richer JavaScript value-type descriptions in error messages, or
other debug/advisor surfaces. Default JavaScript errors still include `code`,
`sqliteCode`, `extendedCode`, and `message`; default prepared statements still
keep `execute()` and `query()` available. The `tracing` feature is also opt-in
because it restores warning-level tracing and pulls in extra browser logging
glue. The `panic-hook` feature is available for browser
crash reports when a larger diagnostic package is acceptable:

```bash
FSQLITE_WASM_FEATURES=diagnostics,tracing,panic-hook ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh
```

## Size Budgets

All release packages must emit the raw `.wasm`, a gzipped `.wasm.gz`, and a
Twiggy top report in CI. The helper also writes `size-report.json` so CI and
manual runs preserve the exact wasm-opt decision, raw/gzip bytes, active
budgets, and packed archive size next to the package artifacts. The core package
budget is enforced against the gzipped WebAssembly artifact because that is the
browser transfer shape.

| Feature combo | Build command | Gzip budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum core | `FSQLITE_WASM_NO_DEFAULT_FEATURES=1 FSQLITE_WASM_TWIGGY=required ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh` | `800000` bytes |
| Default core | `FSQLITE_WASM_TWIGGY=required ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh` | `800000` bytes |
| Diagnostics | `FSQLITE_WASM_FEATURES=diagnostics,tracing FSQLITE_WASM_TWIGGY=required ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh` | `800000` bytes unless the release owner intentionally raises `FSQLITE_WASM_MAX_GZIP_BYTES` |
| Extension bundle | `FSQLITE_WASM_FEATURES=extensions FSQLITE_WASM_TWIGGY=required ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh` | report-only until each extension has its own tracked budget; set `FSQLITE_WASM_MAX_GZIP_BYTES=0` for exploratory measurement |

Manual measurement should use the package helper so the post-bindgen `wasm-opt`
flags and gzip-based artifact selection match CI:

```bash
FSQLITE_WASM_TWIGGY=required ./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh target/fsqlite-wasm-pkg
wc -c target/fsqlite-wasm-pkg/frankensqlite_wasm_bg.wasm.gz
twiggy top target/fsqlite-wasm-pkg/frankensqlite_wasm_bg.wasm
```

When a remote `rch` build or CI job has already produced a wasm-bindgen package
directory, agents can run the package checks without re-entering cargo:

```bash
FSQLITE_WASM_FORBID_LOCAL_BUILD=1 \
FSQLITE_WASM_PACKAGE_ONLY=1 \
FSQLITE_WASM_WASM_OPT=disabled \
FSQLITE_WASM_TWIGGY=disabled \
FSQLITE_WASM_MAX_GZIP_BYTES=0 \
./scripts/build_fsqlite_wasm_package.sh /path/to/wasm-bindgen-output
```

Package-only mode refuses settings that affect the earlier cargo or wasm-pack
build, not postprocessing: `FSQLITE_WASM_TARGET`, `FSQLITE_WASM_MODE`,
`FSQLITE_WASM_SCOPE`, `FSQLITE_WASM_PROFILE`,
`FSQLITE_WASM_STRIP_LOCATION_DETAIL`, `FSQLITE_WASM_FEATURES`, and
`FSQLITE_WASM_NO_DEFAULT_FEATURES`. Build the desired target/profile/feature set
first, then point the helper at that output directory. Because package-only mode
cannot know which Rust flags produced the prebuilt `.wasm`, `size-report.json`
sets `stripLocationDetail` to `null` for package-only runs.

await init();

const db = new FrankenDB(":memory:");
db.execute("CREATE TABLE users(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)");
db.execute("INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES('Ada')");

const result = db.query("SELECT id, name FROM users ORDER BY id");
console.log(result.rows);
```

## WASM Memory Management

FrankenSQLite's WASM package runs inside the browser's WebAssembly linear
memory, so the hard upper bound remains 4 GiB for the whole module. The
database-specific knobs exposed by `FrankenDB.openWithOptions()` and
`FrankenDB.importWithOptions()` let you budget FrankenSQLite's own heap usage
inside that ceiling:

```ts
const db = FrankenDB.openWithOptions(":memory:", {
  pageBufferMax: 256,
  memory: {
    initialPages: 4,
    growthChunkPages: 1,
    maxPages: 512,
  },
});
```

- `pageBufferMax` caps the pager's page-buffer pool in pages.
- `memory.initialPages`, `memory.growthChunkPages`, and `memory.maxPages`
  express the same policy in WebAssembly pages (`64 KiB` each). The byte-level
  aliases `memory.initialReserveBytes`, `memory.growthChunkBytes`, and
  `memory.maxBytes` remain available when callers want exact byte counts.
- `memory.maxPages` / `memory.maxBytes` act as a hard cap for tracked
  `MemoryVfs` heap usage. When the engine crosses that cap, operations fail
  with a structured out-of-memory error instead of trapping through an
  `unreachable`.
- With `FSQLITE_WASM_FEATURES=diagnostics`, `memory.warnAtPercent` derives a
  warning threshold from the tracked max, `memory.warningThresholdBytes` accepts
  exact byte thresholds, and `memory.onWarning` fires once with the same
  byte-level and page-oriented payload as `db.memoryStats()`.
- Diagnostic builds also expose `db.memoryStats()` and emit
  page-cache pressure advisory fields:
  `pageCachePressureLevel`, `pageCachePressureBudgetBytes`,
  `recommendedPageBufferMaxPages`, `recommendedPageBufferMaxBytes`, and
  `trackedHeadroomBytes`. These let the JS side decide when to ratchet
  `pageBufferMax` down before the tracked heap reaches its hard cap.

Diagnostic builds can call `db.memoryStats()` at any point to inspect tracked
heap bytes, page-cache resident bytes, page-cache capacity, configured warning
thresholds, growth events, current linear-memory size/pages (when running under
`wasm32`), and the derived page-cache pressure recommendation.
