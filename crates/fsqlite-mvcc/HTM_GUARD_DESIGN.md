# HTM Fast-Path Guard Design — bd-77l3t

> Architecture, fallback proof, abort telemetry, rollout shape, proof obligations.
> No implementation code. No new crates. No Cargo changes.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

At low concurrency (c1/c4), `FlatCombiner` and `CommitSequenceCombiner` pay
combiner-lock acquisition overhead even when contention is minimal. The uncontested
`try_lock()` path costs ~25ns (mutex CAS + memory barriers). Under c4 with disjoint
keys, this fixed cost dominates over useful batching work.

Hardware Transactional Memory (Intel TSX RTM / ARM TME) can speculatively execute the
`combine_locked()` body in L1/L2 cache without broadcasting cache invalidations,
reducing uncontested fast-path cost to ~5-8ns.

**Goal:** Define a guard architecture that wraps the combiner hot-path with an
HTM-first/lock-fallback discipline, including abort telemetry, dynamic disable,
and formal correctness proofs — all without changing the existing lock behavior
or introducing new crates.

---

## 2. Existing Module Seam

All code changes live within **`crates/fsqlite-mvcc/src/flat_combining.rs`**
and **`crates/fsqlite-mvcc/src/commit_combiner.rs`**. These are the only two
files that contain combiner lock paths.

### 2.1 FlatCombiner (`flat_combining.rs`)

**Existing infrastructure already in place:**

| Line(s) | What exists | Status |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 40-44 | HTM metric names in doc comment | Stub |
| 78-82 | Global metric atomics: `FC_HTM_ATTEMPTS`, `FC_HTM_ABORTS_{CONFLICT,CAPACITY,EXPLICIT,OTHER}` | Allocated, never incremented from real path |
| 84-91 | XABORT bit constants (`XABORT_EXPLICIT`, `XABORT_RETRY`, etc.) | Defined |
| 92-107 | `HtmAbortReason` enum + `HtmAbortClassification` struct | Defined |
| 168-191 | `classify_htm_abort_status()` — const fn abort classifier | Implemented |
| 193-226 | `record_htm_attempt()`, `record_htm_abort_status()`, `note_htm_attempt()`, `note_htm_abort()` | Implemented, never called from real path |
| 425-427 | `try_lock()` → `combine_locked()` — **THE integration point** | Lock path |

The module already has the abort classification, metric counters, and public
recording functions. What's missing is:
1. A **guard state machine** that decides whether to attempt HTM
2. An **abort-rate monitor** with EWMA and dynamic disable
3. The **try-HTM-first call site** in `FcHandle::apply()`
4. Tracing integration per the bead spec

### 2.2 CommitSequenceCombiner (`commit_combiner.rs`)

Identical structure: `try_lock()` → `combine_locked()` at the same logical
position in `CommitCombineHandle::alloc()`. Same guard would apply.

### 2.3 No other files touched

The guard is entirely internal to these two modules. No public API changes.
No new dependencies. No Cargo.toml modifications.

## 3. Guard State Machine

```
                    ┌──────────────┐

   ┌──────────────┐
   │ USER_DISABLED│
   │    (5)       │
   └──────────────┘
```

**Storage:** Single `AtomicU8` — fits in the existing `FlatCombiner` struct
alongside `value`, `slots`, `owners`, `combiner_lock`. Zero heap allocation.

**Transitions:**
- `NOT_PROBED → AVAILABLE`: First call to `apply()` triggers lazy probe
- `NOT_PROBED → UNAVAILABLE`: CPU lacks RTM (or non-x86_64)
- `NOT_PROBED → BLACKLISTED`: Known-buggy CPU stepping detected
- `AVAILABLE → DISABLED`: EWMA abort rate > 50%
- `DISABLED → AVAILABLE`: Cooldown timer expires (5s initial, 2x backoff, max 60s)
- `AVAILABLE → USER_DISABLED`: PRAGMA fsqlite_disable_htm = ON
- `USER_DISABLED → {probe result}`: PRAGMA fsqlite_disable_htm = OFF

---

## 4. Abort Rate Monitor (EWMA)

Stored as additional fields alongside the guard state:

```
ewma_abort_rate: AtomicU32,      // Fixed-point [0..10000] = [0.0000..1.0000]
window_attempts: AtomicU64,
window_aborts:   AtomicU64,
window_start_ns: AtomicU64,
disable_count:   AtomicU32,      // For exponential backoff
last_disable_ns: AtomicU64,
```

**All fit within the existing struct.** No heap allocation. ~48 bytes total.

### Update rule

Every 1000 attempts OR every 100ms (whichever comes first):

```
alpha = 0.3
new_rate = window_aborts / window_attempts
ewma = alpha * new_rate + (1 - alpha) * ewma
```

Fixed-point arithmetic avoids floating-point in the hot path:
```
ewma_fp = (3000 * new_rate_fp + 7000 * old_ewma_fp) / 10000
```

### Disable threshold

If `ewma_abort_rate > 5000` (50%), transition to DISABLED state.

### Cooldown with exponential backoff

```
cooldown_ms = min(5000 * 2^disable_count, 60_000)
```

After cooldown expires, reset EWMA and window, re-enable, increment `disable_count`.

---

## 5. `FcHandle::apply()` — Modified Call Site Shape

The existing code at lines 409-465:

```rust
// Current:
pub fn apply(&self, op: u64, arg: u64) -> u64 {
    // ... publish request to slot ...
    if let Some(_guard) = self.combiner.combiner_lock.try_lock() {
        self.combiner.combine_locked();
    }
    // ... spin-wait ...
}
```

The guard inserts a **pre-lock fast-path check**:

```
pub fn apply(&self, op: u64, arg: u64) -> u64 {
    // ... publish request to slot ...

    // HTM fast-path guard
    let htm_state = self.combiner.htm_state.load(Relaxed);
    if htm_state == AVAILABLE {
        // <-- HTM TRANSACTION BOUNDARY -->
        // Attempt: execute combine_locked() speculatively
        // On commit: return immediately (slot has result)
        // On abort: record_htm_abort_status(eax), fall through
        //
        // The actual _xbegin/_xend calls require a safe wrapper.
        // This design defines WHERE they go and WHAT surrounds them.
        // The wrapper itself is a separate implementation decision.
    }

    // Existing lock path (unchanged)
    if let Some(_guard) = self.combiner.combiner_lock.try_lock() {
        self.combiner.combine_locked();
    }
    // ... spin-wait (unchanged) ...
}
```

**Key constraint:** The code *inside* the HTM boundary must be exactly
`combine_locked()` — the same function, same arguments, same result. The only
difference is the exclusion mechanism.

---

## 6. What Runs Inside the HTM Transaction

The `combine_locked()` body (lines 334-380) does:

1. Load `self.value` (1 AtomicU64 read)
2. Scan `self.slots[0..64]`: for each, load `state` + `payload` (128 atomic reads)
3. For pending slots: compute result, store `payload` + `state` (up to 128 atomic writes)
4. Store `self.value` (1 atomic write)
5. Update 4 metric atomics (Relaxed stores)

**Cache footprint:**
- `value`: 1 cache line (8 bytes in 64-byte line)
- `slots`: 64 × 16 bytes = 1024 bytes = 16 cache lines
- `owners`: not accessed during combine
- Metrics: 4 × 8 bytes = 32 bytes = 1 cache line

**Total: ~18 cache lines ≈ 1152 bytes.** TSX L1D capacity tracks ~32KB.
Well within capacity. Capacity aborts should be rare.

**No I/O, syscalls, or non-transactional stores.** The function is pure
computation over atomic memory. This is the ideal HTM workload.

---

## 7. Tracing Integration (per bead acceptance criteria)

```rust
// At CPU probe time (once per process):
tracing::info!(target: "fsqlite::htm", event = "cpu_probe",
    tsx_available = %tsx, tme_available = %tme,
    stepping = %step, known_buggy = %buggy);

// Before each HTM attempt (debug-level, conditional):
tracing::debug!(target: "fsqlite::htm", event = "xbegin",
    combiner_id = %id, batch_size = %batch);

// After each abort (debug-level):
tracing::debug!(target: "fsqlite::htm", event = "xabort",
    combiner_id = %id, abort_code = %code,
    reason = %reason);  // "conflict"|"capacity"|"explicit"|"retry_exceeded"

// On dynamic disable (warn-level):
tracing::warn!(target: "fsqlite::htm", event = "dynamic_disable",
    abort_rate = %rate, threshold = %thresh, window_ms = %window);

// Periodic snapshot (info-level, every 10s or on demand):
tracing::info!(target: "fsqlite::htm", event = "stats_snapshot",
    attempts = %total, aborts_conflict = %c,
    aborts_capacity = %cap, success_rate = %pct);
```

## 8. Rollout Shape

### Phase 1: Guard skeleton + abort telemetry (this bead)
- Add `htm_state: AtomicU8` + EWMA fields to `FlatCombiner` struct
- Add guard state machine (probe → available/unavailable/disabled transitions)
- Wire abort telemetry into existing metric counters
- Add PRAGMA handler
- **No actual HTM intrinsics.** Default probe returns `UNAVAILABLE` on all platforms.
- **Net effect: zero behavior change.** All threads use lock path as today.
- This can be tested, merged, and verified safe.

### Phase 2: Loom model (child bead bd-2phz6)
- Model the guard+fallback in Loom with exhaustive state exploration
- Prove: no lost updates, no deadlock, no livelock under the guard transitions
- Prove: combine_locked() under HTM produces same linearization as under lock

### Phase 3: Safe HTM wrapper (child bead bd-2w7no)
- Implementation decision for how to call _xbegin/_xend safely
- Options: (a) external C shim linked via build.rs, (b) future safe intrinsics
  RFC, (c) third-party crate with audited unsafe, (d) feature-gated crate-level
  lint override
- This decision is deferred until Phase 1 and Phase 2 are complete

### Phase 4: Abort telemetry (child bead bd-1571a)
- Wire real abort data into the monitor
- Calibrate EWMA alpha and disable threshold against benchmark data
- Publish via `fsqlite_htm_metrics` virtual table

## 9. Proof Obligations

### P1: Lock-equivalence of HTM path
**Claim:** A committed HTM transaction produces the same observable result as
executing `combine_locked()` while holding `combiner_lock`.

**Proof sketch:**
- The HTM path executes identical code to `combine_locked()`.
- HTM commit atomically publishes all writes. The combiner lock provides
  equivalent mutual exclusion.
- Both paths: (a) read the same slots, (b) compute the same results,
  (c) store the same values to the same locations.
- The only difference is the exclusion mechanism (hardware vs. software).
- **Obligation:** Verify no state is accessed between `try_lock()` return and
  `combine_locked()` entry that would differ under HTM. Inspection of lines
  425-427 confirms: `try_lock()` returns `MutexGuard`, then `combine_locked()`
  is called immediately. No intervening state.

### P2: Abort safety (no side effects)
**Claim:** An aborted HTM transaction has no observable side effects.

**Proof sketch:**
- Intel TSX spec: on abort, all speculative memory writes are discarded.
  Architectural register state is restored to XBEGIN snapshot.
- ARM TME: TSTART/TCOMMIT provide same guarantee.
- After abort, thread falls through to existing `try_lock()` path.
- **Obligation:** Verify `combine_locked()` performs no I/O, syscalls, or
  non-transactional stores (e.g., `volatile` writes, MMIO). Code inspection
  confirms: only `AtomicU64` load/store operations and arithmetic.
- **Obligation:** Verify metric updates happen OUTSIDE the HTM boundary.
  Design places `record_htm_abort_status()` call AFTER abort, not inside
  the transaction.

### P3: No deadlock
**Claim:** HTM fast-path cannot introduce deadlocks.

**Proof:**
- HTM transactions are non-blocking: they either commit or abort in bounded
  time. No thread waits for another thread's HTM transaction.
- The fallback lock path is single-lock, no nested acquisition → deadlock-free.
- Guard state transitions are wait-free (atomic CAS on `htm_state`).

### P4: Progress guarantee (no livelock)
**Claim:** The system makes forward progress even under sustained HTM aborts.

**Proof:**
- After MAX_HTM_RETRIES (3) consecutive aborts on a single `apply()` call,
  the thread unconditionally falls through to the lock path.
- The lock path guarantees progress: `try_lock()` either succeeds (combiner
  processes batch) or fails (another thread is combining, and will process
  this thread's published slot).
- Dynamic disable ensures sustained abort storms cause a clean transition
  to lock-only mode within 100ms.
- **Obligation:** Verify the retry count is per-invocation, not global.

### P5: No false-sharing from guard state
**Claim:** Adding `htm_state` and EWMA fields to `FlatCombiner` does not
introduce false sharing on the hot path.

**Design mitigation:**
- Place guard fields on a SEPARATE cache line from `value` and `combiner_lock`.
- `htm_state` (1 byte) + EWMA fields (~48 bytes) fit in one 64-byte cache line.
- The existing `value` field is on its own line; `slots` array is cache-line
  padded; `combiner_lock` is separate.
- **Obligation:** Verify with `#[repr(align(64))]` or explicit padding.

### P6: Metric accuracy
**Claim:** HTM abort telemetry counters are monotonically accurate.

**Proof:**
- Counters use `fetch_add(1, Relaxed)` — no lost updates (atomic increment).
- Updates happen outside HTM transaction boundary — not subject to speculation
  rollback.
- EWMA window resets are racy (two threads may reset simultaneously), but this
  only causes a temporary over-count — the EWMA converges within one window.

## 10. Assumptions Ledger

| # | Assumption | Failure mode | Mitigation |
|---|-----------|-------------|------------|
| A1 | TSX not disabled by microcode/BIOS | _xbegin always returns abort code | Dynamic disable triggers within 100ms |
| A2 | Working set fits in L1D (~32KB) | Capacity aborts | Measured at ~1.2KB; if spikes, dynamic disable |
| A3 | No I/O/syscalls in combine_locked() | Transaction always aborts | Verified by code inspection (pure atomic ops) |
| A4 | Metrics updated outside HTM boundary | Correct telemetry | Enforced by design: record after commit/abort |
| A5 | combine_locked() is total (always terminates) | Livelock inside transaction | 64-iteration bounded loop; no dynamic allocation |
| A6 | Slot state machine is correct without HTM | Lock-path regression | Phase 1 adds only guard skeleton; lock path unchanged |
| A7 | No tracing inside HTM boundary | tracing allocates → capacity abort | Design rule: all tracing calls outside HTM region |

---

## 11. Fallback Trigger Matrix

| Condition | Guard action | Recovery |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| CPU lacks RTM/TME | state = UNAVAILABLE | None — lock path always |
| Known-buggy stepping | state = BLACKLISTED + warn | None — lock path always |
| Single abort, retryable | Retry (up to 3×) | Fall through to lock |
| Single abort, not retryable | No retry | Fall through to lock |
| EWMA > 50% | state = DISABLED + warn | Cooldown (5s, then probe) |
| EWMA > 50% post-probe | DISABLED + 2× backoff | Max 60s cooldown |
| PRAGMA disable_htm = ON | state = USER_DISABLED | PRAGMA OFF to re-enable |
| Phase 1 (no intrinsics) | state = UNAVAILABLE always | Full lock path always |

---

## 12. Virtual Table: `fsqlite_htm_metrics`

Exposes guard state and abort telemetry via SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM fsqlite_htm_metrics;
-- Returns single row:
--   htm_state TEXT,          -- 'available'|'unavailable'|'blacklisted'|'disabled'|'user_disabled'
--   attempts INTEGER,
--   aborts_conflict INTEGER,
--   aborts_capacity INTEGER,
--   aborts_explicit INTEGER,
--   aborts_other INTEGER,
--   success_rate REAL,       -- (attempts - total_aborts) / attempts
--   ewma_abort_rate REAL,
--   disable_count INTEGER,
--   cooldown_remaining_ms INTEGER
```

Implementation: read the existing global atomics + guard state. No new storage.

---

## 13. Risk Assessment

**Net risk of Phase 1 (guard skeleton only):** ZERO.
- No behavior change. All threads use lock path.
- Guard state defaults to UNAVAILABLE.
- Adds ~48 bytes to FlatCombiner struct.
- No new dependencies, no unsafe code, no Cargo changes.

**Highest risk in later phases:**
- Phase 3 (safe HTM wrapper): requires solving the unsafe boundary problem.
  Deferred intentionally. The guard design is independent of this decision.
- Phase 4 (calibration): EWMA parameters need tuning against real workloads.
  Wrong alpha/threshold → disable too eagerly (no benefit) or too slowly
  (brief perf dip). Safe fallback in both cases.
