# and `br doctor` reports the workspace healthy.
#
# Strategy: each bead is created with `br create` and its returned ID is
# captured into a name→id map. Dependencies are then wired with `br dep add`
# using the captured IDs (we cannot pin the bd-* hash beforehand). On any
# `br create` failure the script aborts and prints the failing bead name so
# you can re-run after fixing.
#
# Safe to re-run: skips any bead whose declared title already exists open in
# the workspace (matched on exact title).

Knobs: --processes N (default 8), --duration SECS (default 60), --ops-per-txn K, --workload-mix {balanced,write-heavy,read-heavy,ddl-occasional}. Post-run: open with stock C SQLite via rusqlite, run integrity_check + quick_check + WAL inspection. Emit a structured JSON report.

Section 5.6.3 (per bd-zppf comments) specifies a shared-memory scan release_page_locks_for(txn_id) for the slow-path crash cleanup. Verify: kill -9 a caller mid-transaction, confirm SharedPageLockTable.fsqlite-shm shows the dead pid + birth-time + lease, confirm the next live caller correctly identifies it as dead via process_alive(pid, birth) and CAS-clears the entry, confirm a fresh writer can then acquire the lock. Add a test under tests/crash_recovery/shared_lock_release.rs. Acceptance: test passes 100 iterations under loom (or std-only if loom is too heavy for shm), and the harness from 1.1 cannot keep a lock alive past 1x lease duration after kill."

Subsequent reader B sees CommitIndex=N, looks up the frame, finds it half-written or absent -> torn read. The fix: enforce a strict two-phase ordering -- (1) write WAL frames + fsync(wal_fd), (2) memory-barrier (Release), (3) update CommitIndex with Release ordering. Audit every CommitIndex publish site to confirm it is preceded by an explicit fdatasync (or fdatasync-equivalent on platforms without it) and a Release barrier. Add a debug_assertions-only invariant check that records the last fsync sequence per page and panics if Publish happens before Fsync.

At each boundary, SIGKILL is delivered. Parent then opens stock C SQLite (rusqlite), runs integrity_check, plus opens with fsqlite again and verifies the committed-or-not state is consistent across both engines. Acceptance: 100 iterations at each boundary pass, no integrity failures, no half-committed rows visible."

Before each step(), check schema_epoch_atomic.load(Acquire) >= plan.epoch; if not, return SQLITE_SCHEMA (the same error C SQLite emits) and let the caller re-prepare. The harness from 1.1 must include a DDL-occasional mix that proves the invariant. Acceptance: test_stale_plan_after_cross_process_ddl in tests/concurrent/schema_epoch.rs passes 1000 iterations."

If either fails, dump the WAL header + first 32 frames + checksum chain into the test failure artifact. Acceptance: a single test helper verify_with_c_sqlite(path) exists, every concurrency test calls it, CI uploads the dump on failure."

Process B reads the indicator, sees the lease has not expired, refuses to acquire -- but A is gone. The check_serialized_writer_exclusion CAS-clear loop (bd-zppf) handles this lazily on contention, but a passive reader sees no contention and stays stuck. Add a periodic sweeper (every lease/4) that probes the indicator, CAS-clears it if process_alive(pid, birth) is false, regardless of contention. Acceptance: harness scenario where A is SIGKILL-ed mid-serialized-write resolves within lease/2."

Decide whether to: option A -- revive #30 in full (months of work, broader payoff), option B -- land a minimal commit-snapshot log (weeks, scoped to #82). Output: a one-page design note at docs/design/time-travel-file-backed.md justifying the choice. Acceptance: decision committed, this bead closed with the chosen option recorded as close_reason, follow-up beads filed for the chosen path."

Reuse the existing in-memory snapshot ring machinery (#23) -- only the root_page binding differs.
